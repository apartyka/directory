The home for files submitted to Updox's UI coding challenge

###Steps to get up and running:
* clone this repo
* using terminal or other command line tool, `cd` to your chosen project directory
* run `npm install` or `sudo npm install` (depending on your user profile) for dependencies
* `gulp` will start a local webserver and the project will run on `http://localhost:8000/`
* the project can also be viewed as a static file by opening the /build/app/index.html file in a browser
* any other problems just ask me!
